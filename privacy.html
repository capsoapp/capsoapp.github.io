                        <p>
                             We may collect information that can identify you such as your name and 
                            email address ("personal information") and other information that does 
                            not identify you. We may collect this information through a website or a mobile application. By using the Service, you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service.
                        </p>

                                authorize us to access certain Facebook account information, such as 
                                your public Facebook profile (consistent with your privacy settings in

You will also be asked to allow Capso to collect your location information from your device when you download or use the Service.

If you share capso with other Capso users, you provide us the related content, and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication.

                                We may use standard Internet technology, such as 
                                web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our 
                                Service and to deliver or communicate with cookies. We also may include 
                                web beacons in advertisements or email messages to determine whether 
                                messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in 
                                this manner enables us to customize the services we offer users, to 
                                deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness
                                 of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.

                                We may allow service providers, advertising 
                                companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display 
                                advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking 
                                technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information 
                                about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not 
                                provide any non-anonymized personal information to third parties. Some 
                                of these third- party advertising companies may be advertising networks 
                                that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a 
                                single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies 
                                (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting out will not decrease the number of
                                 advertisements you see.

                                <p>Aggregated and/or non-personal information.
                                 We may use and share non-personal information we collect under any of 
                                the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to 
                                develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Service and on websites 
                                or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on 
                                advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect 
                                with additional non- personal information collected from other sources. 
                                We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal 
                                information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, 
                                including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of 
                                conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. For 
                                example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from
                                 you (including IP address and information about your browser or 
                                operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser
                                 to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may 
                                reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you 
                                voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we 
                                may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable 
                                form. To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or 
                                advertising partners, please go to http:// www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>

                        <h4>4. How we protect your personal information</h4>
                        <p>
                            We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, videos, content, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
                        </p>

                        <h4>5. Information you provide about yourself while using our Service</h4>
                        <p>
                            We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use . Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
                        </p>

                        <h4>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
                        <p>
                            We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our Service from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.
