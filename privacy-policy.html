Some of these third- party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see.</li></ul><h2>2. How we use the information we collect</h2><p>In General.

The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.

How we protect your personal information</h2><p>We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, videos, content, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank" class="link">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm </a>for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p><h2>5. Information you provide about yourself while using our Service</h2><p>We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use . Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p><h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our Service from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p><div class="clearfix"></div><hr></article><footer class="footer light"><p class="links"><a href="mailto:support@capso.cc" class="terms-link">Contact Us</a><span class="split">|</span><a href="/terms-of-use" class="terms-link">Terms of Use</a><span class="split">|</span><a href="/privacy-policy" class="terms-link">Privacy Policy</a></p><p class="copyright">© 2015 Capso Co.,Ltd.
